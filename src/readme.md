# Excercise #1 - Phone Numbers

## THE GOAL
By joining the brand new iAndroid smartphone development team, you have been given the responsibility of developing the contact manager.

Obviously, what you were not told is that there are strong technical constraints for iAndroid: the system doesnâ€™t have much memory and the processor is as fast as a Pentium from 1993.

Your task is to write a program that displays the number of items (which are numbers) required to store a contact list of all telephone numbers.

## SPECIFICATIONS

Number storage optimization is really important here. Fortunately, the specifications also have this little chart to guide you in the implementation:
