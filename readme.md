## COMMANDS
- `npm test` - runs basic set of tests that are checking functionality of the implemented function (Used in the pipeline as the main passing criteria)
- `npm run test:style` - runs additional set of tests that are checking if the implemented function is conforming to functional and clean code conventions setup for this workshop
- `npm run test:performance` - runs additional set of tests that are using high amount of data to stress test the implemented function checking for the time and memory usage of the functions
